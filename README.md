hi i'm hafiz. currently studying. started coding at around 9 to 13 and had to stop because my laptop couldn't keep up with the updates and all. 
personally i think that AI has taken over what i do and what i used to do for fun, it just ruins everything, 
now everybody uses AI to code and take credit for whatever reason.
i'm studying statistics which is largely data based! and just a little bit math-based.
back then, when i got errors on my java programs i'd go to stackoverflow and look for fixes but now it's different, you don't do that anymore, i have no hate for people who use AI in their code but it just takes away the creativity, the hard work to do things.
